## üìã Setup Steps

```javascript
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SCRIPT_WEB_APP_URL_HERE';
```

Replace with your actual Google Apps Script URL:

```javascript
const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/ABC123.../exec';
```

### 3. Deploy index.html

You have several options:

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Free)
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload `index.html`
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**

Open `photo-link-generator prefill application.html` and find line ~699:

```

Replace with your actual index.html URL:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = 'https://yourusername.github.io/reponame/index.html';
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Change Default Photos

Edit `index.html` around line ~1444 to change the default photos shown when no URL parameters are provided:

```javascript
const DEFAULT_PHOTO_REQUIREMENTS = [
    {
        id: 'front-exterior',
        title: 'Front Exterior of Home',
        description: 'A clear view of the entire front of the house, including the roof.',
        category: 'exterior'
    },
    // Add more default photos here
];
```

### Adjust Image Compression

Edit `index.html` around line ~2013 to adjust compression settings:

```javascript
const options = {
    maxSizeMB: 1,          // Maximum size in MB (default: 1MB)
    maxWidthOrHeight: 1920, // Maximum dimension (default: 1920px)
    useWebWorker: true,
    fileType: file.type
};
```

- **Higher maxSizeMB** = Better quality, slower upload
- **Lower maxSizeMB** = Faster upload, lower quality
- **1MB is a good balance** for most insurance photos
